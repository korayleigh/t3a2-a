# Meeting 5 - 28 Jan 22

## 1. Progress Update

- Koray has finished desktop MVP wireframes and therefore all of the MVP wireframes are now complete.
- Leigh has expanded the Readme Description section, replacing dot points with paragraphs.

## 2. Blockers
- None

## 3. Next Steps

- Koray will start on the "planning methodology" section of the readme.
- Leigh will revise dataflow diagrams with some colours, including clear indication of non MVP features
- Koray will review Leigh's Readme Description section

## 4. Down the track
- Start thinking about how to attack Part B, and other planning steps that may be required to ensure we are both working from the same information in the coming weeks.
- For example: what entities are required (order, menu item)? and how will the database be designed? This could be put into an Entity Relationship Diagram.
