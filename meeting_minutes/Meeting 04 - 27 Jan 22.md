# Meeting 4 - 27 Jan 22

## 1. Progress Update

- Koray has updated mobile MVP wireframes based on feedback, and is working on the wireframes for tablet platform for all the MVP features, expect these to be finished today.
- Leigh has completed the application architecture diagram

## 2. Discussion of wireframe / DFD features - MVP only, or extras as well

Iryna and Glen have now both confirmed that these should be MVP only, and any additions to the app can be documented later as required.

## 3. Discussion of MVP admin login feature's user stories

- Agreed that as per multiple sources of guidance including atlassian, user stories are written from the perspective of a user persona rather than user role
- Agreed that there's no need to have the user's status (logged in or not) explicitly written as user stories should be implementation agnostic
- Agreed that a single user story detailing the need for the site administrator to restrict access to staff-only functions (such as orders dashboard) is sufficient

## 4. Blockers

No blockers

## 5. Next Steps

- Koray to continue working on wireframes
- Leigh will revise readme and flesh out the existing bullet points
